# üß¨ Breast Cancer Classification Project

A deep dive into machine learning and neural networks for breast cancer classification, leveraging both Decision Tree classifiers and dense neural networks to achieve high accuracy in differentiating between malignant and benign tumors.

## üìù Project Overview
This project uses the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset to develop a robust classification model, combining scikit-learn's Decision Tree classifier with a dense neural network model built with TensorFlow. The goal is to achieve high sensitivity and precision in identifying malignant cases, pushing the boundaries of AI applications in healthcare.

### Key Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Implemented with scikit-learn's `Pipeline` and `ColumnTransformer` to ensure consistent scaling and handling of missing values.
- **Modeling**: Utilizes both a **Decision Tree** classifier for interpretability and a **Neural Network** model for deep pattern recognition.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Extensive evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, validated on separate test and validation datasets.
